Baseline Assessment - Action plan step 1
When you are ready to launch your accreditation effort, JCI consultants can work with you to conduct an on-site baseline assessment of your organization’s readiness for accreditation. This in-depth review compares your current services and processes to JCI standards and identifies areas for improvement.

Step 1-- This baseline organizational assessment provides a foundation for a Customized Survey Preparation Plan for the JCI survey readiness. 
We evaluate your Organization’s status and current level of compliance with specific JCI standards with our comprehensive Baseline Assessment tools. This initial assessment is tailored to meet your Healthcare’s specific scope of service, client population and settings.

Mock Survey – step 4
Many organizations conduct a mock survey prior to their accreditation survey that serves as the  final checkpoint in readiness. JMT consultants can work with you to simulate the actual survey process and identify gaps in standards compliance. This intensive organization-wide exercise is an ideal opportunity to engage senior leaders and prepare staff for the actual survey.




Focused Consulting - Training And Eval step 3
Before or after the mock survey, JCI consultants can provide crucial support in high- priority areas where you are struggling with compliance. Your staff and leadership can work with our expert team to develop a customized agenda using a combination of focused tracers, work groups, and on-site training to identify practical solutions.

Tracer Methodology Education Program - Training And Eval  step 3
Tracer methodology is a cornerstone of the JCI accreditation philosophy. Our intensive, three- or five-day hands-on program is ideal for hospitals or health systems who want the very best instruction in tracer techniques in identifying breakdowns in care.

Facilities Management - Training And Eval step 3
Facility safety and emergency preparedness are rather overlooked when a hospital prepares for accreditation, yet they can pose real challenges, especially in older buildings. Our consultants help you evaluate your facilities against JCI standards in  re safety, emergency preparedness, and other critical areas.

Custom Education – Training And Eval Step 3
You can request on-site education for the precise topics where you need assistance. Our experienced faculty share leading practices and “how-to” solutions with your staff, including what to expect during the survey process.

Quality Improvement - Training And Eval step 3
Custom training or a three-day educational workshop may be what is needed to help improve your organization’s policy development and management processes, which will help drive continuous quality improvement across departments and functions.
